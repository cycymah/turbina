    lyric: `Fall into the deep end\n
    Feeling alive while you fight for your life\n
    As you swim back to the beaches\n
    Don't be scared of the tide just prepare for the ride\n
    I think I'm misunderstood\n
    I think I'm just under goo\n
    I think I'm not so bad\n
    Tell me what's wrong with that\n
    I think I'm over my head\n
    I think I'm over depressed\n
    I know I overthink\n
    Spending nights over sinks\n
    Throw up 'cause I can't find out why I'm sad\n
    Everything is bad, but it seems fine\n
    No signs of struggle, always neglected\n
    Boy in the bubble can't be affected\n
    Can't get in trouble, can't get seem to get that\n
    If not for trouble, no learning lessons\n
    Trying to be subtle, trying to be gentle\n
    Physically fit but sick in the mental\n
    Fall into the deep end\n
    Feeling alive while you fight…\n

    lyric: `
    On a cobweb afternoon\n
    In a room full of emptiness\n
    By a freeway I confess\n
    I was lost in the pages\n
    Of a book full of death\n
    Reading how we'll die alone\n
    And if we're good, we'll lay to rest\n
    Anywhere we want to go\n
    In your house I long to be\n
    Room by room patiently\n
    I'll wait for you there\n
    Like a stone\n
    I'll wait for you there\n
    Alone\n
    On my deathbed I will pray\n
    To the gods and the angels\n
    Like a pagan to anyone\n
    Who will take me to heaven\n
    To a place I recall\n
    I was there so long ago\n
    The sky was bruised\n
    The wine was bled\n
    And there you led me on\n
    In your house I long to be\n
    Room by room patiently\n
    I'll wait for you there\n
    Like a stone\n
    I'll wait for you there\n
    Alone\n

    lyric: `
    Yeah, addicted to life, had to pay a heavy-ass price\n
    Sacrifice worth waitin' on the platinum and ice\n
    I'm precise with the merchandise, came back like Christ\n
    To change the game, while y'all niggaz remain the same\n
    Clear the lane, comin' through like Kobe, you can't hold me\n
    You can't stop me, ever since I dropped 'Paparazzi'\n
    I done watched the game unfold into some hideous shit\n
    Like every idiot that can spit be droppin' a hit\n
    I transmit for the convicts, committed, never bullshitted\n
    Shadowbox, detox, my own worse critic\n
    It's like tryin' to squeeze water from rocks\n
    I negotiate the neighborhood stops and clean your clock with a glock\n
    Sick of niggaz screamin' they hot but really they not\n
    Beatin' you all to the ground like six L.A. cops\n
    Put your fist up in the air if you ever been shot\n
    And lived to tell about it, never leavin' home without it, c'mon\n
    There's no one out there for us to fear\n
    I'll say it loud and clear\n
    (Yeah, we ain't scared of nothin' y'all motherfuckers)\n
    Who can say they're close to us\n

      You keep dreaming and dark scheming\n
      Yeah, you do\n
      You're a poison and I know that is the truth\n
      All my friends think you're vicious\n
      And they say you're suspicious\n
      You keep dreaming and dark scheming\n
      Yeah, you do\n

      Holding me down\n
      You're killing me slow\n
      So slow, oh-no\n
      I feel like I'm drowning\n
      I'm drowning\n
      You're so plastic and that's tragic\n
      Just for you\n
      I don't know what the hell you gonna do\n
      When your looks start depleting\n
